    "introduction": "Hi! I’m a Full-Stack Developer who is always looking for new challenges.\nDuring my years as an IoT Engineer, I honed my skills in C# and RESTful API development, while also working with technologies like Kubernetes, MySQL, Angular, TypeScript, and more. I have experience with version control systems such as GitHub and Azure Repos.\nBeyond my professional work, software development is my passion. I consider my job a hobby, and I actively work on multiple side projects and open-source contributions. Through these, I’ve gained experience using Adobe XD, Figma, Code-First methodology with ASP.NET Core, and developing responsive and high-performance frontends with Angular.\nI hold a BSc in Computer Science Engineering from Óbuda University and am currently pursuing an MSc in Software Engineering at ELTE. In my new role as a Full-Stack Developer, I focus on building scalable and efficient solutions.\nI’m always eager for new challenges—feel free to reach out!",
